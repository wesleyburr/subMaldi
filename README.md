# subMaldi
subMALDI is an open framework package for the R programming environment that permits organization,  pre-processing (smoothing, baseline correction, peak detection), and normalization of spectral data sets. As a result of the package's design, subMALDI data objects are compatible with functions from a wide variety of other R packages, and user-defined functions are easier to implement and test.
